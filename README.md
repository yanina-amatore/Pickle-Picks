# Pickle's Picks

## About the project

Updates : ATM i'm working on unit tests. I'm a little out of practice so this is a great way of doing a refresher :)

This was initially a Bootcamp project that I started with some friends but still needed to finish. I've refactored some initial code, added a delete review feature, improved website navigability and styled it using Bulma.
It's still buggy, and I am working on adding images to the database and conditionally rendering some buttons.

I couldn't deploy it yet but If you want to check it out you can ask me for the JWT secret code in linkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanina-amatore/  and I'll share it with you.



## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run

```


To run in development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run in production:
```sh
npm start
```


## Week 7 Large group project

The focus of this app is to practice using the Full Stack we teach, (with auth in place) in a large scale app.

The idea of the app is to create a blog style site for [Pickle](https://www.instagram.com/pickleapproves/) to post about places they have eaten at and review them, and for people who follow Pickle to be able to save places for them to eat at later.

As she grows in popularity, Pickle hopes to make the world (or at least Wellington) a more dog-friendly place! Not just dog-tolerant.


## The Tech

A Boilerplate is already set up for you with everything you will need to get started. This boilerplate is set up to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)
* [Bulma (CSS framework)](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
* [Authenticare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authenticare)

The migration and seeds for the users table, and all login functionality is already set up!

The mobile responsiveness is also being handled by some neat JS and Bulma classes, be sure to incorporate that view in your project goals!

## User Stories

### MVP

As a non-registered user:
* I want to register for the App under my name
* I want to browse a list of all the places Pickle has reviewed
* I want to read an individual review from Pickle and see any other details about it
* I want to sort the places by Pickle's rating

As a registered user:
* I want to save reviews to a "Wishlist" so I can eat at that place too!
* I want to view my saved Wishlist

### Stretch

As a registered user:
* I want to add my own rating to the places Pickle has reviewed.
* I want to add my own comment/review beneath Pickle's review so I can share my experience.
* I want to see other user's reviews of the same place when viewing a review from Pickle.
* I want to browse the places Pickle has reviewed on a map.

As Pickle:
* I want a form only I, Pickle, can access so I can upload a new review.

## Authentication

Authentication is already set up in this project using the node module [authenticare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authenticare). Users are currently able to login, logout, and register and all user information will be stored in a table in our database.

If you wish to dive deeper on authenticare, docs are avalable [here](https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/authenticare/tree/main/docs). Of particular note are `getEncodedToken` and `getTokenDecoder` as they deal with how you add a token to your request and secure server routes respectively.

## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
